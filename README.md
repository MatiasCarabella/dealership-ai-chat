API-driven application featuring an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist or replace sales representatives at car dealerships. It uses AI to provide customers with detailed information about available vehicles, answer their queries, and offer tailored suggestions based on the dealership's inventory.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Provides intelligent, context-aware responses.
- **Real-Time Inventory Integration**: Fetches vehicle details directly from the database.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy-to-deploy solution requiring minimal setup.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- API key for [**Groq**](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview) (AI provider)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dealership-ai-chat.git
cd dealership-ai-chat
```

2. Set up the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file file to set your [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview):
```
GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
3. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build 
```
_The `init.sql` script automatically sets up the database schema along with sample data during the Docker container build process, so no manual setup is required!_

4. Access the application on http://localhost:8000/api.
